# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms is a C++ program that tests the sorting performance on several different types of containers for 250,000 elements. The program tests the time taken to sort the array when it's elements are distributed randomly, in order, reversed order, organ pipe, and rotated. 

## Running Sorting Algorithms

Open a command line prompt at the directory containing main.cpp. Run the following command, substituting in your own file name for name-you-want-to-give:

```bash
g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> source.cpp
```
To run the program:
```bash
./name-you-want-to-give
```
